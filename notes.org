Access to fetch at 'https://registry.npmjs.cf/-/v1/search?text=ligo-foo' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, *', but only one is allowed. Have the server send the header with a valid value, or, if an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.

*** Yarn: =git://= instead of =https://=

Yarn sometimes has fetching packages from Git repositories directly
over =https://=

Add the following to =.git/config=

#+begin_src conf
  [url "https://"]
	  insteadOf = git://
#+end_src
